# This script is invoked by Android build system "WITH_SYNTAX_CHECK=1 make ..." and
# accepts command line in the following format:
#
#    cxx-syntax ARCH LOCAL_CXX ...
#
# It calls "clang++ -fsyntax-only ..." to utilize clang's better diagnostics
# before calling "LOCAL_CXX ..." for code generation.  ARCH is translated
# into "-target XXX" (see below) to get proper pre-defined preprocessor
# symbols/macros.  Some clang-specific warnings are disabled to be compatible
# with Android toolchain mostly gcc.
#
# The compilation time is slightly longer, and the generated object file
# should be the same as w/o WITH_SYNTAX_CHECK
#
# Note that although Android build system doesn't call LOCAL_CXX with any of
# the following flags, this script should check and skip "clang -fsyntax-only"
# if options contain any of the following: '-print-*', '-dump*', '@*', '-E',
# '-' or '-M', for use elsewhere.
