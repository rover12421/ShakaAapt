# This script is invoked by Android build system "WITH_SYNTAX_CHECK=1 m/mm/mmm ..." and
# accepts command line in the following format:
#
#    ccc-analyzer ARCH LOCAL_CC ...
#
# Under WITH_SYNTAX_CHECK=1, m/mm/mmm/mma/mmma wrap "make" with "tools/scan-build/scan-build"
# which utillizes "clang --analyze" for static code analyses.  Script scan-build interposes
# on compiler with CC/CXX ignored by the Android build system unfortunately.  Instead,
# Android build system recognizes WITH_SYNTAX_CHECK and replace LOCAL_CC with our own ccc-syntax,
# which in turn setup the following env. vars expected by tools/scan-build/ccc-analyzer
#
#   CCC_CC: The origianl LOCAL_CC which does the real compilation and code-gen
#   CLANG: The clang compiler which run code analyses
#
# Our own ccc-syntax also export the following, and tools/scan-build/ccc-analyzer is slightly
# modified to prefix/append them in options passed to clang for successful compilation
#
#   CLANG_FLAGS: Flags to set correct target, be compatible with gcc, etc
#   CLANG_FLAGS_END:  Flags to override "$@"
